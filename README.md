# isFileInputSupported.js v1.0
### Detects if input type=file is supported on mobile browsers (and on desktop tooâ€¦)


[isFileInputSupported.js](https://arie.ls/2012/file-upload-support-on-mobile/) is a tiny JS plugin which detects if input type=file is supported or not. It's using similar code as Modernizr does, but it also includes a separate user agent regexp to check against browsers that falsely report support. There are quite many of those false positives really, at least all Windows Phone devices running OS 7.0-8.0, Android devices running OS 1.0-2.2, Kindle devices running OS 1.0-3.0 and all WebOS devices running OS 1.0-3.0.5 (Although the latter ones being quite old already).
